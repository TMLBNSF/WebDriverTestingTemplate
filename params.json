{"name":"Selenium WebDriver Gradle Template","tagline":"A Gradle template for JUnit Selenium WebDriver tests","body":"# Info\r\n\r\nThis is a Java project that can be used as a template (or archetype) to start a WebDriver web browser testing<br/>\r\nproject.  I chose to simplify and and implement using simply WebDriver and Gradle.<br/>\r\n\r\nI am very much interested in others forking my code and/or letting me know how it can be improved.\r\n\r\nThe idea here is to replace your existing automation framework, such as \"HP Quality Center\", \"XStudio\", or \"Rational<br/>\r\nFunctional Tester\", with a pure Java solution managed by the Gradle build system.   I use Jenkins to schedule my tests<br/>\r\nand run them.\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0 - March 16, 2013\r\n\r\n\r\n# Project Layout\r\n\r\n    Eclipse Root\r\n    +--- Project ':root'\r\n    +--- Project ':sub-project'\r\n    +--- Project ':commonlib'\r\n    +--- Project ':google'\r\n    +--- Project ':parallelwebdriver'\r\n    +--- ...\r\n\r\n# Overview\r\n\r\n    1. Project \"sub-project\" is a project you add yourself, if you want.\r\n    2. Project \"google\" is a RemoteWebDriver JUnit test-suite using a local Grid server that is capable of running\r\n       multiple threads of web browser tests.\r\n    3. Project \"parallelwebdriver\" is a test of a  multi-window multi-threaded run using a static local website.\r\n    4. Project \"commonlib\" is a sub-project containing methods shared between projects.\r\n    5. Project \"root\" is an 'includeFlat' Gradle-layout-alias to Eclipse project-root-dir 'WebDriverTestingTemplate'.\r\n\r\n# Quick Start\r\nNormally, this project would be ran through the Gradle plugin for Eclipse IDE, but I have tried to make it easier by<br/>\r\nincluding a method to run dynamically and directly from the .zip distribution on the command line.\r\n\r\nTo try this project without requiring a Java IDE, just make sure you download Gradle 1.4, configure your\r\nGRADLE_HOME<br/> environment variable, add %GRADLE_HOME%\\bin to your PATH, and then download the .zip distribution\r\nof this<br/> project, unzip it, and run the included <b>root/runProjectMenu.bat</b> script.\r\n\r\n# Implemented Features\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th>Feature</th>\r\n    <th>Description</th>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th>JUnit based</th>\r\n    <td>For use ONLY with JUnit 4.11 or higher because of the usage of the parameterized capability<br/> of JUnit. This dependency is configured by the Gradle build script.</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n    <th>Parallel runner<br/>using JUnit</th>\r\n    <td>A parallel runner using the Gradle maxParallelForks method.</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th>Native automation support</th>\r\n    <td>For use with Sikuli 1.0.1 or higher to test native elements that WebDriver \"Action\" is<br/> unable to control.

I was planning<br/>\r\n       to implement this but currently having trouble getting it to work.</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n# Configuration And Setup\r\n\r\n#### Eclipse\r\nTo get it working on a regular Eclipse 4.2.1 or later, follow these steps:\r\n \r\n    1. Using the \"Eclipse Marketplace\" settings panel under the Eclipse \"Help\" menu, install the Gradle tooling\r\n       functionality.  You can do it through the \"Install New Software\" menu, but it isn't recommended.\r\n    2. Download the .zip archive of this GitHub project distribution and unzip it to your workspace.  An example\r\n       might be:  \"C:\\Eclipse32\\workspace\\WebDriverTestingTemplate\\\" .\r\n    3. Use the Eclipse \"Import\" function from the Eclipse \"File menu\" to import a \"Project\" of type \"Gradle\".\r\n    4. Browse using the import wizard to your projects \"root\" sub-directory described in Step #3 (above).  Then \r\n      click the \"Build model\" button.  We do this because of the \"includeFlat\" Gradle layout.\r\n    5. Check all checkboxes .  You could also choose to add all to your \"working set\" if you like but it isn't \r\n       required.\r\n    6. Rebuild the dependencies by right clicking on the project and then choose Gradle-->Refresh All Dependencies\r\n    7. Right click on your project and choose \"Run As-->External Tools Configuration\".  Configure a new \"clean\" \r\n       and \"build\" configuration for running a sub-project (or whatever tasks you want to execute).\r\n    8. Optionally, you can run this project on the command line with \"gradle identify google:show google:clean\r\n       google:build --info\" and it will execute the project unit tests.  Also, this project provides a .bat batch\r\n       script that does this and provides a menu of other actions you can execute.\r\n\r\n#### IntelliJ-IDEA\r\nThe required Gradle functionality is already built into IntelliJ-IDEA 12.1+ .  I think using IDEA is more difficult\r\nbut go ahead if you are familiar with it.\r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\nWebsite of this project:<br/>\r\nhttp://djangofan.github.com/WebDriverTestingTemplate/<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n# FAQ\r\n\r\n    1. If the intellisense in Eclipse doesn't work, make sure you have added all the .class directories to\r\n       your Eclipse project classpath.  (See the included .classpath file.)\r\n    2. I use \"GitHub GUI\" to sync my local project repo to GitHub.  If you fork my project, I would recommend\r\n       doing it this way unless you are a Git expert and prefer another way.\r\n    3.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
