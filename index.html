        <h1>Info</h1>

<p>This is a Java project that can be used as a template (or archetype) to start a WebDriver web browser testing<br>
project.  I chose to simplify and and implement using simply WebDriver and Gradle.<br></p>

<p>I am very much interested in others forking my code and/or letting me know how it can be improved.</p>

<p>The idea here is to replace your existing automation framework, such as "HP Quality Center", "XStudio", or "Rational<br>
Functional Tester", with a pure Java solution managed by the Gradle build system.   I use Jenkins to schedule my tests<br>
and run them.</p>

<h1>Versions</h1>

<p>Version 1.0 - March 16, 2013</p>

<h1>Project Layout</h1>

<p><br>
Eclipse Root <br>
+--- Project ':root'<br>
+--- Project ':sub-project'<br>
+--- Project ':commonlib'<br>
+--- Project ':google'<br>
+--- Project ':parallelwebdriver'<br>
+--- ...<br><br></p>

<h1>Overview<br>
</h1>

<ol>
<li>Project "sub-project" is a project you add yourself, if you want.<br>
</li>
<li>Project "google" is a RemoteWebDriver JUnit test-suite using a local Grid server that is capable of running<br>multiple threads of web browser tests.</li>
<li>Project "parallelwebdriver" is a test of a  multi-window multi-threaded run using a static local website.<br>
</li>
<li>Project "commonlib" is a sub-project containing methods shared between projects.<br>
</li>
<li>Project "root" is an 'includeFlat' Gradle-layout-alias to Eclipse project-root-dir 'WebDriverTestingTemplate'.</li>
</ol><h1>Quick Start</h1>

<p>Normally, this project would be ran through the Gradle plugin for Eclipse IDE, but I have tried to make it easier by<br>
including a method to run dynamically and directly from the .zip distribution on the command line.</p>

<p>To try this project without requiring a Java IDE, just make sure you download Gradle 1.4, configure your
GRADLE_HOME<br> environment variable, add %GRADLE_HOME%\bin to your PATH, and then download the .zip distribution
of this<br> project, unzip it, and run the included <b>root/runProjectMenu.bat</b> script.</p>

<h1>Implemented Features</h1>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
<tr>
<th>JUnit based</th>
    <td>For use ONLY with JUnit 4.11 or higher because of the usage of the parameterized capability<br> of JUnit. This dependency is configured by the Gradle build script.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<th>Parallel runner<br>using JUnit</th>
    <td>A parallel runner using the Gradle maxParallelForks method.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<th>Native automation support</th>
    <td>For use with Sikuli 1.0.1 or higher to test native elements that WebDriver "Action" is<br> unable to control. This dependency is configured in the Gradle build script.  If you implement<br> this however, you may not be able to use the remote webdriver option in<br> your project. </td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<th>Uses RemoteWebDriver<br>JSON Hub Server</th>
    <td>I have included an implementation of a WebDriverServer class that starts a RemoteWebDriver<br> JSON Hub server instance in the BeforeClass method of tests. This server is a static member <br>of the utility class that the tests extend. </td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<th>Parameterized data <br>driven capability</th>
    <td>Unit tests are parameterized from a csv file.  Can also load tests from XML, XLS, a database, etc.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<th>Logging and Reporting</th>
    <td>Logs test output to console and to a file using SLF4j/LogBack API, and configured by<br> a <b>logback.xml</b> file. Will generate reports of JUnit test results at<br><b>build/reports/test/index.html</b> .  Will place a junit.log file at <b>build/logs/junit.log</b> .</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<th>Page Object design <br>pattern</th>
    <td>Uses the WebDriver "page object" design pattern, enhanced by the Selenium<br> "LoadableComponent" extendable class.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<th>Fluent API design<br>pattern</th>
    <td>Implemented examples of the <i>Fluent API</i> design pattern while retaining capability of <br>
    the traditional page object pattern.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<th>Multi-project build<br>configuration</th>
    <td>Implemented multiple project build.  The root project has a subproject called "core" and all <br>
   subprojects of "core" inherit classes from it.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<th>Run Options</th>
    <td>You have three different options for running the tests: via the Gradle GUI, via your IDE<br>Gradle
    plugin, or via Gradle command line. To run with<br>the JUnit runner in your IDE, 
    you would need to manually export your project <br>as a normal Java project, because this template does
    not support that.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<th>Core utility package</th>
    <td>All projects inherit from a "core" project that contains classes where you can store methods<br>
        that all of your projects can share between them.</td>
  </tr>
</table><h1>Un-implemented Features</h1>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
<tr>
<th>Gradle Wrapper</th>
    <td>Did not choose to implement the Gradle wrapper because I believe that downloading Gradle and<br>
       configuring GRADLE_HOME and PATH are easy enough.  Also, a manual setup of Gradle gives<br>us more
       control using a batch script.  Also, the development IDE can be configured to use the <br>
       statically defined Gradle home.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<th>Jar executable option</th>
    <td>Creates an uberJar of all projects and subprojects that can be ran by double clicking<br>
       the .jar file.  If you don't have the file association supporting it, we include a <br>
       jarAssociation.bat file to setup the file association on your Windows system.  I was planning<br>
       to implement this but currently having trouble getting it to work.</td>
  </tr>
</table><h1>Configuration And Setup</h1>

<h4>Eclipse</h4>

<p>To get it working on a regular Eclipse Juno (rather than Spring Source Suite) then perform the following<br>
steps.  If you deviate from these steps you risk importing the project incorrectly. You know you did it<br>correctly if your imported project resembles the screenshot I provided called "layout.png".</p>

<ol>
<li>Add the following software repositories to your Eclipse software update panel:<br>
a. "SpringSource Update Site for Eclipse Juno 4.2" - <a href="http://dist.springsource.com/release/TOOLS/update/e4.2">http://dist.springsource.com/release/TOOLS/update/e4.2</a> <br>
If you have Eclipse 3.x, then the Sprint 3.7 update site may work for you.  <br>
(<a href="http://www.springsource.org/STS-installation-instructions">http://www.springsource.org/STS-installation-instructions</a> )</li>
<li>Install the new software components called "Gradle Tooling API" and "Gradle IDE". Restart Eclipse. <br>
</li>
<li>Download the .zip archive of this GitHub project distribution and unzip it to your workspace.  An example<br>
might be:  "C:\Eclipse32\workspace\WebDriverTestingTemplate\" .<br>
</li>
<li>Use the Eclipse "Import" function from the Eclipse "File menu" to import a "Project" of type "Gradle".</li>
<li>Browse using the import wizard to your projects "root" sub-directory described in Step #3 (above).  Then click<br>
the "Build model" button.  We do this because of the "includeFlat" Gradle layout.</li>
<li>Check all checkboxes .  You could also choose to add all to your "working set" if you like but it isn't required.<br>
</li>
<li>Rebuild the dependencies by right clicking on the project and then choose Gradle--&gt;Refresh All Dependencies <br>
</li>
<li>Right click on your project and choose "Run As--&gt;External Tools Configuration".  Configure a new "clean" and "build"<br>
configuration for running a sub-project (or whatever tasks you want to execute).<br>
</li>
<li>Optionally, you can run this project on the command line with "gradle identify google:show google:clean <br>
google:build --info" and it will execute the project unit tests.  Also, this project provides a .bat batch<br>
script that does this and provides a menu of other actions you can execute.</li>
</ol><h4>IntelliJ-IDEA</h4>

<p>Intellij-IDEA has a nice Gradle plugin that is included.  The steps are otherwise similar to the Eclipse steps #3-#7 <br>
above but I believe Eclipse is easier to use.</p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>

<ol>
<li>If the intellisense in Eclipse doesn't work, make sure you have added all the .class directories to<br>
    your Eclipse project classpath.  (See the included .classpath file.)</li>
<li>I use "GitHub GUI" to sync my local project repo to GitHub.  If you fork my project, I would<br>recommend doing it this way unless you are a Git expert and prefer another way.</li>
