#Sample project for WebDriver handling multiple windows
===========================

Example of different methods of handling popup windows with Selenium WebDriver.  If you would like
to add your own method, fork my code and then send me a "pull request" and I will review it and
add it.

##Running this project
1. You need to first start the web HTTP server located at:
  https://github.com/djangofan/WebDriverTestingTemplate/blob/master/multiwindowtest/src/test/resources/startWebServer.bat
2.  Then, start the Grid Hub and the Grid Node that are contained at:
   https://github.com/djangofan/WebDriverTestingTemplate/blob/master/root  

NOTE: If  you are running the 'runAllTests' task, you don't need to start the HTTP server because
   the test code starts one for you in the static AllTests suite class.
