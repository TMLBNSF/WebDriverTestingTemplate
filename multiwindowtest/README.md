#Sample project for WebDriver handling multiple windows
===========================

Example of different methods of handling popup windows with Selenium WebDriver.  If you would like
to add your own method, fork my code and then send me a "pull request" and I will review it and
add it.

##Running this project
1. You need to first start the web HTTP server, the Grid Hub, and the Grid Node 
   that are contained in the 'root' project of this GitHub repo.  NOTE: If  you are 
   running the 'runAllTests' task, you don't need to start the HTTP server because
   the test code starts one for you in the static AllTests suite class.

##Methods Implemented So Far
===========================
1. A window "Handle Cache" method using "TestHandleCache" class.
2. 
3.
