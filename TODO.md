#Selenium WebDriver Testing Template

## TODO List:

Note: Some of these things might not be possible or practical to implement.

1. Improve unit test logging. Display HTML report of JUnit results from Gradle command line by using a XSL transformation of the result.xml file. Email test results similar to how TestNG generates an emailable report.
2. Unit tests read system properties that are set by Gradle runtime.  This feature could be used to force running only from Gradle runtime only.
3. Improve WebDriver code that handles waiting for html page elements.
4. Improve the Page Object design pattern so that it is type safe and with better separation of script from framework.
5. Improve .bat  batch script to launch tests, compile, and perhaps handle Git events.
6. Add "TODO" comments to existing code to mark where code needs improvements.
7. Convert project to a Gradle multi-project and have the .bat file handle running multiple projects independently.
8.
